Ph.D. in acoustics. Postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/) in the [Ocean Data Lab](https://sites.uw.edu/abadi/) on marine mammal localization using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS).

Former student of [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/), I did a Ph.D. in Acoustics at [UMRAE](https://www.umrae.fr/). The joint research unit is hosted by two institutes: the [CEREMA - Strasbourg](https://www.cerema.fr/en) and the [Université Gustave Eiffel - Nantes Campus](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/en/), working together on noise characterization and reduction of its environmental impact.
